**Did:**
- **Learning Coach AI customization** (`coaching.py`, `app.py`): fields with no static
  coaching setup (no `topic_type`/`coaching_framework` -- e.g. Gym, Job Applications) now
  get AI-generated coaching content (Focus On / Ask Yourself / Interview Check / Mistakes
  / Mental Models / Pro Tip), tailored to the exact task text. Triggers automatically the
  first time such a task becomes active in Focus Mode (background thread, same pattern as
  the existing DSA/SQL problem generator), cached onto `block["ai_coaching"]` so it's not
  regenerated on every render. Falls back to the old static "nothing set up" panel if no
  AI backend is configured or the response is unusable. DSA/backend/database/system_design
  fields were deliberately left untouched -- scope was "fill the gaps only", not "make
  every field task-specific" (user's explicit choice).
- **Profiles CLI wiring** (`cli.py`): `profiles.py` existed as a complete data/crypto
  layer but was never wired into anything. Added `mtdo profile list|current|create
  [--password] [--from-current]|switch|delete [--force]|import`. `switch` saves the
  outgoing profile's live `~/.mtdo/{goals.json,state.json}` back into its own (possibly
  encrypted) storage before loading the incoming profile's data, prompts for passwords
  with a 3-attempt retry limit, and refuses to silently clobber an existing *unmanaged*
  `~/.mtdo/goals.json` (i.e. one never adopted into a profile) -- tells the user to run
  `create --from-current` first. Deliberately CLI-only for v1 (user's choice) -- no
  in-app/TUI profile switcher yet.
- Installed `cryptography` (was a declared but never-installed dependency -- pre-existing
  gap, not caused by this session's changes) via
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/bin/python3.14 -m pip install -e . --break-system-packages`
  from `~/mtdo`, with explicit user approval for overriding Homebrew's PEP 668 protection.
  Without it, `--password` profiles fail with a clear ProfileError (not a crash).
- Created this agent (`~/.claude/agents/mtdo-dev.md`) and this progress log per user
  request, so mtdo work can resume without re-briefing.

**Tested:** All profile CLI paths (create/list/current/switch/delete, including
password-protected create+switch, wrong-password retry-then-fail, `--from-current`
adoption, active-profile delete guard, confirmation-name mismatch) exercised end-to-end
against a scratch `HOME`, never the real `~/.mtdo`. `coaching.parse_ai_coaching_response`
unit-tested against a realistic sample response. All touched files pass
`python3 -m py_compile`. **Not yet tested:** the AI-coaching-generation path live inside
the running Textual app (no UI smoke test done -- only the parser and static wiring were
verified).

**Not committed yet** as of writing this entry -- `git status` shows `app.py`, `cli.py`,
`coaching.py` modified, nothing staged/pushed. Per standing habit, commit+push+pull should
happen before this session ends (see mtdo-dev.md's Git workflow section).

**Next / open items:**
- Commit and push today's changes (see above).
- Live-verify the AI coaching generation panel in a real Focus Mode session (e.g. via
  tmux, per the gotchas doc) -- background-thread wiring was code-reviewed and unit-tested
  but not run inside the actual TUI.
- If ever wanted later (not requested yet): a TUI-side profile switcher, and/or extending
  AI customization to make DSA/backend/etc. content task-specific instead of shared
  generic buckets (both were explicitly deferred by the user on 2026-08-20).
