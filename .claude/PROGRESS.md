## 2026-08-20 (update -- separate `mtdo-sandbox` command for testing, isolated from real data)

User asked for a genuine dev/test instance of the app, separate from the real one --
"test app vs PROD app" was the framing. The scratch-`HOME` approach used earlier that
same day for the live AI-coaching test was a one-off workaround, not something usable
day to day, and it had a real downside: overriding `$HOME` also breaks whatever else
reads `$HOME` (it broke the `claude` CLI's own credential lookup during that test). This
needed a real fix, not another one-off.

**Did:**
- **Root cause / fix:** 8 modules independently hardcoded `os.path.expanduser("~/.mtdo/...")`
  for their own path constants (`config.py`, `profiles.py`, `ai_backend.py`, `errorlog.py`,
  `code_runner.py`, `plan_wizard.py`, `web_chat.py`, `pty_panel.py`) -- no single source of
  truth, so nothing could relocate "mtdo's data" as one unit. Changed `config.APP_DIR` to
  `os.environ.get("MTDO_HOME") or os.path.expanduser("~/.mtdo")` (default behavior
  unchanged for every existing install) and refactored the other 7 modules to derive their
  constants from `appconfig.APP_DIR` instead of recomputing their own `expanduser` calls.
- **New `mtdo-sandbox` command** (`sandbox_entry.py`, registered in `pyproject.toml`'s
  `[project.scripts]`): sets `MTDO_HOME=~/.mtdo-sandbox` via `os.environ.setdefault`
  *before* importing `cli` (has to happen first -- those path constants are computed once
  at import time, so setting the env var from inside an already-imported module would be
  too late). Fully separate goals/state/profiles/error.log/memory.md/secrets/practice/
  transcripts from the real `mtdo` -- confirmed nothing is shared.
- **`mtdo reset` / `mtdo-sandbox reset`** (`cli.cmd_reset`): wipes the *current* app dir
  and starts fresh. Hard safety guard -- refuses unconditionally if `appconfig.APP_DIR`
  resolves to the real `~/.mtdo`, regardless of how it was invoked, so this can never
  wipe real data even by mistake. Requires typing `reset` to confirm on top of that.
- Fixed several hardcoded `"~/.mtdo/goals.json"`-style strings in `cli.py`'s user-facing
  profile messages (were misleading under `mtdo-sandbox` -- would claim to be touching
  `~/.mtdo` while actually operating on `~/.mtdo-sandbox`) to display the real resolved
  path with `$HOME` collapsed back to `~`. Also added `_PROG` (derived from
  `os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])`) so "run `mtdo` to start" style messages correctly say
  `mtdo-sandbox` when that's what was actually run -- otherwise a sandbox session would
  tell the user to run plain `mtdo`, which silently switches back to real prod data.
- Reinstalled editable (`--break-system-packages`, same interpreter/reason as the
  `cryptography` install earlier today) so the new console script actually exists on PATH.

**Tested (real, not just code review):** `mtdo-sandbox` launched in a real tmux pty --
confirmed it shows the first-run onboarding walkthrough and the built-in demo config
(generic "Cardio + gym" etc, not Mukund's real curriculum), and that it wrote
`config.yaml`/`state.json`/`error.log`/`onboarded` under `~/.mtdo-sandbox` while real
`~/.mtdo/goals.json` and `config.yaml` mtimes stayed untouched (from Aug 17, before this
session). Verified `mtdo reset` refuses on real prod with the exact guard message, that
`mtdo-sandbox reset` requires typing `reset` and declines on any other input, and that a
correct confirmation actually removes `~/.mtdo-sandbox` while leaving `~/.mtdo` alone.
Verified profile create/list/delete under `mtdo-sandbox` show `~/.mtdo-sandbox/...` and
`mtdo-sandbox ...` in their messages (not `~/.mtdo`/`mtdo`), and that plain `mtdo`
commands still show the real paths/program name unchanged. All 8 touched modules import
cleanly with no circular-import issues; full `python3 -m py_compile` pass.

**Next / open items:**
- None outstanding for this feature. If ever wanted: a `--sandbox` flag as an alternative
  to a separate binary, or extending profile-style isolation *within* the sandbox (not
  requested).

## 2026-08-20 (update -- live-tested the AI coaching panel)

Committed and pushed the 2026-08-20 changes below (commit `ab35750`, already synced with
origin/main). Then did what the prior entry flagged as untested: live-verified the
AI-coaching-generation panel.

**How:** Real `claude -p` via a real tmux pty against a scratch `HOME`/goals.json (a bare
"gym" fixed_labels category, no topic_type/coaching_framework) confirmed the actual
failure path end-to-end -- trigger fired automatically on the in_progress gym task,
background thread ran, `claude -p` was actually invoked, its error ("Not logged in" --
an artifact of overriding `$HOME`, which also breaks the `claude` CLI's own credential
lookup, not an app bug) was caught, logged to `~/.mtdo/error.log`, cached as
`ai_coaching: false`, and the static fallback panel rendered correctly with the updated
"AI couldn't generate any either" copy. Then used Textual's `App.run_test()` headless
harness (same real `TodoApp`, same real background-thread/`call_from_thread` path, just
`ai_ask.ask` monkeypatched to a canned response instead of needing live external auth) to
verify the success path: transient "Asking the AI to tailor coaching notes..." panel while
in flight, `ai_ask.ask` called exactly once, response parsed correctly by
`parse_ai_coaching_response`, cached onto `block["ai_coaching"]`, panel re-rendered with
"AI-tailored for this task" and all six sections populated, and a second
`refresh_side_panels()` call confirmed the cache is respected (no duplicate AI call).

**Verdict: working as expected**, all three states (generating / success / failure)
confirmed in a real running app, not just unit tests. Real `~/.mtdo` was never touched --
scratch `HOME` throughout, cleaned up after.

**Did (original entry, 2026-08-20):**
- **Learning Coach AI customization** (`coaching.py`, `app.py`): fields with no static
  coaching setup (no `topic_type`/`coaching_framework` -- e.g. Gym, Job Applications) now
  get AI-generated coaching content (Focus On / Ask Yourself / Interview Check / Mistakes
  / Mental Models / Pro Tip), tailored to the exact task text. Triggers automatically the
  first time such a task becomes active in Focus Mode (background thread, same pattern as
  the existing DSA/SQL problem generator), cached onto `block["ai_coaching"]` so it's not
  regenerated on every render. Falls back to the old static "nothing set up" panel if no
  AI backend is configured or the response is unusable. DSA/backend/database/system_design
  fields were deliberately left untouched -- scope was "fill the gaps only", not "make
  every field task-specific" (user's explicit choice).
- **Profiles CLI wiring** (`cli.py`): `profiles.py` existed as a complete data/crypto
  layer but was never wired into anything. Added `mtdo profile list|current|create
  [--password] [--from-current]|switch|delete [--force]|import`. `switch` saves the
  outgoing profile's live `~/.mtdo/{goals.json,state.json}` back into its own (possibly
  encrypted) storage before loading the incoming profile's data, prompts for passwords
  with a 3-attempt retry limit, and refuses to silently clobber an existing *unmanaged*
  `~/.mtdo/goals.json` (i.e. one never adopted into a profile) -- tells the user to run
  `create --from-current` first. Deliberately CLI-only for v1 (user's choice) -- no
  in-app/TUI profile switcher yet.
- Installed `cryptography` (was a declared but never-installed dependency -- pre-existing
  gap, not caused by this session's changes) via
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/bin/python3.14 -m pip install -e . --break-system-packages`
  from `~/mtdo`, with explicit user approval for overriding Homebrew's PEP 668 protection.
  Without it, `--password` profiles fail with a clear ProfileError (not a crash).
- Created this agent (`~/.claude/agents/mtdo-dev.md`) and this progress log per user
  request, so mtdo work can resume without re-briefing.

**Tested:** All profile CLI paths (create/list/current/switch/delete, including
password-protected create+switch, wrong-password retry-then-fail, `--from-current`
adoption, active-profile delete guard, confirmation-name mismatch) exercised end-to-end
against a scratch `HOME`, never the real `~/.mtdo`. `coaching.parse_ai_coaching_response`
unit-tested against a realistic sample response. All touched files pass
`python3 -m py_compile`. AI-coaching-generation path now live-tested too -- see the
update entry above.

**Committed and pushed** -- commit `ab35750`, confirmed in sync with origin/main.

**Next / open items:**
- If ever wanted later (not requested yet): a TUI-side profile switcher, and/or extending
  AI customization to make DSA/backend/etc. content task-specific instead of shared
  generic buckets (both were explicitly deferred by the user on 2026-08-20).
